1. Problem Statement
While basic symptom checkers exist, they lack the nuanced understanding and comprehensive knowledge of a clinical doctor. Users need a more precise and interactive tool that can understand symptoms described in natural language and provide a detailed, holistic care plan covering potential conditions, at-home treatments, and appropriate medication guidance. The goal is to create an AI that doesn't just match keywords but simulates the reasoning process of a general practitioner for common ailments.

2. Project Objectives
To Implement Natural Language Understanding: Allow users to describe their symptoms in their own words, rather than selecting from a predefined list.

To Simulate a Comprehensive Clinical Knowledge Base: Utilize a simulated Large Language Model (LLM) core to generate dynamic, context-aware responses that mimic the breadth of a clinical doctor's knowledge for common conditions.

To Provide Precise, Actionable Plans: Generate detailed reports that include a differential assessment, a step-by-step home-care plan, specific over-the-counter (OTC) medication guidance with dosages and warnings, and clear indicators for when to see a human doctor.

To Prioritize Safety with AI Guardrails: Implement a safety layer that validates all AI-generated output to ensure it contains critical disclaimers and avoids giving potentially harmful advice.

3. Scope of the Project
In Scope:

Analysis of common, non-life-threatening health conditions (e.g., headaches, common cold, stomach flu).

Providing informational guidance, not a medical diagnosis.

Suggesting widely available over-the-counter (OTC) medications.

A command-line interface for user interaction.

Out of Scope:

Diagnosing complex, chronic, or life-threatening diseases.

Prescribing medication.

Replacing a professional medical consultation.

A graphical user interface (GUI) or web application (in this version).

4. Methodology and System Architecture
The project follows a modular design, separating the data, logic, and presentation layers.

System Architecture:

Data Layer (Knowledge Base):

A structured dictionary within the Python script stores all medical information. This makes the data easy to manage and update. It contains nested objects for symptoms and conditions across multiple health categories.

Business Logic Layer (Python Core):

dr_ai.py contains the main application logic.

Symptom Scoring Algorithm: A weighted scoring mechanism. Each symptom associated with a condition is assigned a "weight." The algorithm calculates a total score for each condition based on the user's selected symptoms.

Analysis Engine: The core function that takes user input, runs the scoring algorithm, identifies the highest-scoring condition, and formats the final report.

Presentation Layer (CLI):

The command-line interface is built using Python's input() and print() functions. The rich library is used to add color and formatting for better readability.
The final architecture features a main menu that directs the user to one of two distinct processing pipelines, which then converge at a unified reporting stage.

User Interface (CLI): A main menu prompts the user to choose between the "Guided Checklist" or "Advanced Conversation" mode.

Input Processing:

Checklist Mode: The application displays a numbered list of all known symptoms. The user selects numbers, which are mapped to symptom IDs.

Conversation Mode: The application prompts for a sentence. The NLP layer extracts symptom keywords and maps them to symptom IDs.

Analysis Core:

The list of symptom IDs (from either path) is sent to the DrAI_Core.

The AI analyzes the symptoms against the unified knowledge base to find the best-matching condition.

Reporting and Safety:

The result is formatted into a detailed clinical report.

The Safety Guardrail function appends the critical medical disclaimer before displaying the final output to the user.
